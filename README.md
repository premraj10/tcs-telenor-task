The purpose of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to demonstrate some code.
The requirement is simple, but it is important to demonstrate clean code and good test coverage.
Do the absolute minimum work required for the application. Out of the box configurations and in-memory DBs will do just fine.
There is no time limit, but it shouldn't take more than 60-90min. 

---

In a basic Dockerized Springboot Maven application, build a single REST API endpoint that returns a filtered set of products from the provided data in the data.csv file

`GET /product`

Query Parameter			     |       Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- type					     |   The productEntity type. (String. Can be 'phone' or 'subscription')
- min_price				     |   The minimum price in SEK. (Number)
- max_price				     |   The maximum price in SEK. (Number)
- city					     |   The city in which a store is located. (String)
- property				     |   The name of the property. (String. Can be 'color' or 'gb_limit')
- property:color		     |	 The color of the phone. (String)
- property:gb_limit_min      |	 The minimum GB limit of the subscription. (Number)
- property:gb_limit_max      |	 The maximum GB limit of the subscription. (Number)

The expected response is a JSON array with the products in a 'data' wrapper. 

Example: GET /product?type=subscription&max_price=1000&city=Stockholm
{
	data: [ 
		{
		    type: 'subscription',
		    properties: 'gb_limit:10',
		    price: '704.00',
		    store_address: 'Dana gärdet, Stockholm'
	  	},
	  	{
		    type: 'subscription',
		    properties: 'gb_limit:10',
		    price: '200.00',
		    store_address: 'Octavia gränden, Stockholm'
	  	}
	]
}

Your solution should correctly filter any combination of API parameters and use some kind of a datastore.
All parameters are optional, all minimum and maximum fields should be inclusive (e.g. min_price=100&max_price=1000 should return items with price 100, 200... or 1000 SEK). 
The applications does not need to support multiple values (e.g. type=phone,subscription or property.color=green,red).

We should be able to:
- build the application with Maven
- build the Docker image and run it
- make requests to verify the behavior

Please provide an archive with the source code and a list of the terminal commands to build and run the application.

## Tools
Following are the tools needed to build and run the project:
- Maven
- Docker

## How to run
Following are the commands that are needed to run from project root directory

    $ mvn clean package
    $ docker build -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker .
    $ docker run -p 8081:8081 -t springio/gs-spring-boot-docker
    
After that one can test with sample requests. Example is given in the following section. After finish run following commands:
    
    $ docker ps
   
Now you have the container id. Run the following command with container id:
   
    $ docker stop container_id
    
In fact, you can use `ctrl+c` which will stop the container. 

## Sample Request
One can use postman to make the following request:

    http://localhost:8080/product?type=subscription&max_price=1000&city=Stockholm

Or can use curl from command line (given that curl is available in your terminal):
    
    $ curl -i http://localhost:8080/product?type=subscription&max_price=1000&city=Stockholm
    
## Test
For running test following is the command:
    
    $ mvn test
